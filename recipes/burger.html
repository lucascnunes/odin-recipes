        <h3>Beer Cheese Sauce</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup half and half</li>
            <li>1/2 cup light beer</li>
            <li>2 cups grated sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground mustard</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Pour beer, paprika, chili powder, red pepper flakes, and garlic cloves into a resealable plastic bag.
                Add chicken, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the
                refrigerator, at least 4 hours.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>
                Cook chicken on the prepared grill until no longer pink and juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes per side.
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, make cheese sauce. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour; whisk
                continuously until mixture turns golden and forms a smooth paste. Pour in half and half and beer; stir
                until mixture thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in cheese until melted, 2 to 3 minutes more. Stir in
                paprika, garlic powder, and ground mustard.
            </li>
            <li>
                Toast hamburger buns on the grill until they show grill marks, about 2 minutes. Add your favorite
                toppings, pour cheese sauce on top, and serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
